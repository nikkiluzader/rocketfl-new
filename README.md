# RocketFL

## Purpose

This project is meant to be a public website where users can see the upcoming rocket launches in Florida. The one thing I want to set this project apart from others is the map interactivity. The goal is to allow users to get a good estimate of which direction to look in order to view the lauch. For the most part, rocket launches from Cape Canaveral and Kennedy Space center head east, and viewers can usually just look in the direction of the lauchpad for a chance to see it. I would like to incorporate a few more variables into the mix such as the users current elevation, weather, time of day, and sigt to the horizon line to give the launch visibility a "score" as well as a good general direction for the user to look towards.
